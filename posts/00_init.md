# Initialization

For a long while I have had a list of various different technologies, frameworks,
languages, etc. that I have wanted to try out. The problem for me has been
creating the time to do this exploration.

We've recently made some changes at [dojo4](https://dojo4.com), one of which
is to explicitly commit to working on things to improve dojo4. I've decided to
spend my time working on this project and writing about it.

The journey is the goal. I'm not looking to come to a arrive at a specific
conclusion, just learn along the way and see what happens.

This will be done by implementing roughly the same web application in a
variety of different approaches. I'll be using different application stacks for
every implementation. Some regular, some irregular, some very familiar, some
well out of my comfort zone. Whatever strikes my fancy. Different frontend
styles, different API styles, different application server technologies, and
definitely a few different implementation languages.

I'm not going to list the possibilities here, there's too many options.

## Something in Common

Since this is to be a bit of comparison of ways of doing things, there needs to
be a common basis. For this project - I've decided that that is going to be a
web application based around a publicly available dataset.

Picking that dataset is the subject of the next post.

enjoy!
